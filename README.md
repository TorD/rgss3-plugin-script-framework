Plugin Framework for RPG Maker VXAce / RGSS3
============================================
The Plugin Framework for RPG Maker VXAce is an alternative to using the build-in code editor. While the editor is sufficient for many projects and uses, once you get to a substantial amount of scripts, managing them all starts requiring a lot of manual labor. I don't like manual labor when I can help it.

The Plugin Framework aims to make your life easier by doing the following:
* Group scripts into folders and subfolders. And subfolders of subfolders of subfolders, if you like.
* Order scripts the way you want to, by using an optional array. By default, files are read alphabetically.
* Exclude files using simple options. This is handled using arrays, and you can implement your own logic for how to do this smartly. Examples will be provided.
